## Project 1: Java Notes Manager:
Project Overview:
Develop a Java Notes Manager that allows users to create, update, and analyze text-based notes efficiently. This application will enable users to:

* Create a new Java note “JavaFile1.txt” (enter the given text from the console and save it to this file)

_Java is an object-oriented programming language._
_It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism._
_File handling in Java allows for efficient reading and searching of text._
_Keep learning and mastering Java!_

* Display the existing Java note (read and display file content on the console).
* Create another Java note “JavaFile2.txt” and (enter the given text from the console and save it to this file)
_This is the first line in this JavaFile2.txt file._
* Read the content of Java note “JavaFile1.txt” and copy it to “JavaFile2.txt” using file steams. (Keep the previous text intact and add it from the next line)
* Analyze the “JavaFile1.txt” note, providing:
  * Total number of characters?
  * Total number of lines?
  * Total number of words?
* Search for the word “polymorphism” in “JavaFile1.txt” and print the line number where it appears and also find the total occurrences of this word in this file.

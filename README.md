# Java Projects
A collection of projects of Java classes
## Project 1: Java Notes Manager:
Project Overview:
Develop a Java Notes Manager that allows users to create, update, and analyze text-based notes efficiently. This application will enable users to:

* Create a new Java note “JavaFile1.txt” (enter the given text from the console and save it to this file)

_Java is an object-oriented programming language._
_It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism._
_File handling in Java allows for efficient reading and searching of text._
_Keep learning and mastering Java!_

* Display the existing Java note (read and display file content on the console).
* Create another Java note “JavaFile2.txt” and (enter the given text from the console and save it to this file)
_This is the first line in this JavaFile2.txt file._
* Read the content of Java note “JavaFile1.txt” and copy it to “JavaFile2.txt” using file steams. (Keep the previous text intact and add it from the next line)
* Analyze the “JavaFile1.txt” note, providing:
  * Total number of characters?
  * Total number of lines?
  * Total number of words?
* Search for the word “polymorphism” in “JavaFile1.txt” and print the line number where it appears and also find the total occurrences of this word in this file.

## Project 2: Online Bank Account Management System:
Project Overview:
Design and implement a simple *Online Bank Account Management System* using Java that **demonstrates robust exception handling**. The system should allow users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and view their account balance. It must handle different runtime issues such as invalid input, negative deposit amounts, and withdrawal attempts exceeding the available balance. To manage these scenarios, use Java’s exception handling features including try, catch, finally, multiple catch blocks, throw, throws, and user-defined exceptions. The goal is to ensure the application behaves reliably and gracefully under error conditions, promoting strong programming practices related to exception management.

Create a simple command-line bank account management system where users can:
* Create an account
* Deposit money
* Withdraw money
* View balance

The program should handle various exception scenarios using:
* User-defined exceptions for custom error situations
* try-catch-finally for safe execution
* Multiple catch blocks for different exception types
* throw and throws to handle and propagate errors
